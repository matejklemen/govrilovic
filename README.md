## What is this?
Have you ever searched for a form on any of the Slovenian government's sites and could not find it?  
Do you always print the wrong form for scholarship application?  
  
We have a simple solution - just use this tool to crawl all the .gov.si websites, extract any
pdfs, ppts, docxs, print them all and bring them with you to the administrative office - one of
them is bound to be correct!

**JK** - this is an implementation of a relatively simple crawler that crawls through
predefined .gov.si websites and extracts data from them. It is implemented for the purposes of
first assignment in the **Web information extraction and retrieval** course.

## Brief guidelines
1. Write tests when/if possible.
2. When writing regex, either explain it (comment the code) like you would explain it to a monkey
or use something other than regex for solving the problem.
3. Comment non-obvious code.
